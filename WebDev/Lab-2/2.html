Its primary goal is to achieve a successful soft landing on the lunar surface, particularly near the south pole, an area of significant scientific interest due to potential water ice deposits. The mission includes a lander, Vikram, and a rover, Pragyan, designed to explore and send back data about the Moon's geology, mineral composition, and atmosphere. Chandrayaan-3 builds on the learnings from Chandrayaan-1 and -2, positioning India as a key player in lunar exploration.
